<h2 class="heading">What is Commerce</h2>
<p>Commerce made its way into English from the Latin word commercium — com-, meaning "together," and -mercium, meaning "merchandise." Business, trade, and retailing are all common synonyms.Commerce is essential to the global economy. It encompasses everything related to the buying and selling of goods and services at both the wholesale and retail levels.
<br><br>
<img class="margin"src="image1.web.jpg" alt="here we are study about classification of commerce" height="90%" width="80%" >
<br>
<br>Commerce is the exchange of goods and services between individuals, businesses, or nations, usually involving the buying and selling of items of value. It often occurs on a large scale and utilizes money as a medium for transactions.Commerce doesn't always refer to buying and selling, though, just as the marketplace doesn't always refer to goods and services.

            <strong class="heading">
                Wholesale
            </strong>
                <p>Wholesale trade involves the sale of goods in large quantities to retailers, other businesses, or industrial consumers, rather than to the general public. Wholesalers act as intermediaries between manufacturers and retailers.</p></li>
            <li>
            <strong class="heading">
                Retail
            </strong>
                <p>Retail trade involves selling goods directly to the final consumers in smaller quantities. Retailers serve as the last link in the supply chain between wholesalers or manufacturers and the public.</p></li>
            </ol>
            <li>
            <strong class="heading">
                External Trade
            </strong>
                <p>External trade refers to the exchange of goods, services, and capital across international borders or between different countries.It can be classified into three categories:</p>
         <ol type="i">
            <li>
            <strong class="heading">
                Import
            </strong>
                <p>Import refers to the act of bringing goods or services into a country from abroad. It can also mean introducing new ideas, customs, or products from one location to another.</p>
            </li>
             <li>
            <strong class="heading">
                Export
            </strong>
                <p>Exports are goods and services that are produced in one country and sold to buyers in another country. They are a key component of international trade, along with imports.</p>
             </li>
             <li>
            <strong class="heading">
                Entrepot
            </strong>
                <p>Entrepôt refers to an intermediary center of trade and transshipment where goods for import or export are stored without paying import duties. Hong Kong is noted as a significant entrepôt for the Chinese mainland.</p>

            </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
    <strong class="heading">
        Auxillaries to Trade
    </strong>
        <p>Auxiliaries to trade covers all those activities which help in the efficient flow of commercial activities. There are various hindrances in undertaking trade. Auxiliaries to trade help in eliminating those hindrances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
            <strong class="heading">
                Transportation
            </strong>
            <p>Transportation eliminates the hindrance of place by supplying or sending the goods from their place of manufacturing to the place of consumption. As we know, the goods are manufactured in one place but are demanded at various locations. To solve this problem, the transportation activities are proved to be helpful.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <strong class="heading">
                Warehousing
            </strong>
            <p>Warehousing removes the hindrance of time and storage. Various goods are produced in a particular season but are demanded throughout the year for daily uses like cotton, sugar, juice, etc. Other than this, there are some goods which are demanded in a particular season only such as woolen clothes, cotton clothes, umbrellas, etc. Hence, warehousing provides proper storage and safety to these goods for future trading.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <strong class="heading">
                Banking
            </strong>
            <p>The banking sector helps in eliminating the hindrance of finance by providing financial support to the organization or enterprise. As we know, there is a time gap between the production and consumption of goods which means there will be a gap between the investment and receiving the payments of funds. In such a case, the banks help the entrepreneur in raising funds so that the production activities of the firm will not be affected.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <strong class="heading">
                Insurance
            </strong>
            <p>Insurance is helpful in removing the hindrance of fear or risk of loss during transporting goods from one place to another. It also reduces the risk of loss of goods by theft or fire.
            </p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <strong class="heading">
                Advertising
            </strong>
            <p>Advertising removes the hindrance of information/knowledge in the market by informing the customers and making them aware of the goods and services provided by the producers. The seller can use various channels like radio, internet, television, newspaper, etc. to advertise their products.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <strong class="heading">
                Communication
            </strong>
            <p>The goods and services offered by the sellers are needed to be communicated among the buyers as well as buyers should also convey their needs to the sellers by way of orders. This need of both the buyers and sellers can be transferred by the way of communication.</p>
